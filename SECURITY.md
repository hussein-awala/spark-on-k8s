# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is still under development and does not have a stable version yet.
In the current state, the security issues will be addressed as soon as possible in a new patch release or a new minor
release if there is any merged pull request that introduces a new feature.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, you can open a private security
advisory via this [link](https://github.com/hussein-awala/spark-on-k8s/security/advisories/new), and after providing
the necessary information, we will review your advisory and take the necessary actions to fix it.
