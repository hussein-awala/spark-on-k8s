# Spark On Kubernetes

Spark on Kubernetes is a python package that makes it easy to submit and manage spark apps on Kubernetes.
It provides a Python client that can be used to submit apps in your API or scheduler of choice, and a CLI
that can be used to submit apps from the command line, instead of  using spark-submit.

It also provides an optional REST API with a web UI that can be used to list and manage apps, and access the
spark UI through the reverse proxy.
